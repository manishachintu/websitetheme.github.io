                <p> Eating fruits brings many benefits to the body because of the necessary elements and nutritional value, it is rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and a lot of minerals. A study found that people who eat fruits daily increase their immunity
                    and lack of chances of infection with many diseases. One of the characteristics of fruits is that they contain a few calories, This means they are useful in slimming and weight loss programs and reduce body fat percentage.They also
                    contain a high amount of fiber that treats constipation and indigestion. Other essential nutrients include: Potassium, which prevents blood pressure, reduces the chances of kidney stones. As for vitamin C, most fruits contain a high
                    percentage of it, it is important in the prevention of influenza, and in the construction and repair of damaged body tissues, and has an important role in facilitating the absorption of iron from food, and thus protects against anemia.
                    The importance of red fruits stems from the fact that they contain a high percentage of antioxidants, as they contain a component of Lycopene which has a very high ability to resist cancer. It also contains a compound (resveratrol)
                    which prevents the growth and spread of cancer cells. Examples of these fruits: tomatoes, kakas, berries, watermelon, strawberries.

        <div class="about">
            <div class="paras p">
                <p>The importance of fruits to the body is numerous. This year, through the teacher specialized in nutritional health, we were able to learn many of the health benefits for the body that we gain when eating fruits. And about the state of
                    mood and health and the ability of some fruits to raise the body’s immunity. And its importance to address many of the diseases that we get as a result of the low level of immunity in the body.And that there are different benefits
                    for each type of fruit, and that each type affects a group of body organs more. Like bananas, we find that it maintains an increase in energy in the body. It also reduces the chances of developing anemia, and maintains the level of
                    blood pressure. Contrary to what we have learned about watermelon, we find that it benefits the skin more than bananas, and that there are multiple differences between each fruit and multiple benefits. We find that watermelon works
                    to moisturize the skin, and it also helps to increase collagen in the body. And it contains antioxidants, which helps reduce the appearance of signs of aging. Therefore, I find that fruits are of great importance to all people and
                    we must learn a lot about them to know how to eat them in order to benefit from them usefullyFruit is very important, as it has been proven to be rich in fiber, salts and minerals important for the body. It is preferable to eat the
                    fruit two hours after meals. Where it has been proven that this is the ideal timing for the body to respond to benefit from the nutrients in the fruit. One of the things I loved about fruit is that each type of fruit contains different
                    beneficial elements. The more you know about it, the more benefits you take. For example, red grapes contain quercetin, which helps reduce heart and circulatory problems. And eating dates before bed helps regulate blood sugar levels.
                    Therefore, we find that there are various differences and benefits in each type of fruit. So it’s great to take it as needed. In addition to having it to improve the mood.</p>
